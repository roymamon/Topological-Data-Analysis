This project applies core tools from Topological Data Analysis (TDA) to explore  
and analyze the shape of complex datasets using Python.  
Specifically, it focuses on persistent homology and the Mapper algorithm,  
both of which help reveal structural and topological features.  

**Part 1:** Persistent Homology Diagrams for `data_A` and `data_B`.  
**Part 2:** Mapper Graph for `exploratory_data`.
